:sectnums:
:sectnumlevels: 4


Here is a checklist for developers who are developing UI plugins. This
_could_ be used for certification purposes.

== General UI Guidelines

=== The Spirit of Eclipse

TIP: [guideline1.1]*Guideline 1.1* +
Follow and apply good user interface design principles: user in control,
directness, consistency, forgiveness, feedback, aesthetics, and
simplicity.

TIP: [guideline1.2]*Guideline 1.2* +
Follow the platform lead for user interface conventions.

TIP: [guideline1.3]*Guideline 1.3* +
Be careful not to mix UI metaphors. It may blur the original concept,
and your own application.

TIP: [guideline1.4]*Guideline 1.4* +
If you have an interesting idea, work with the Eclipse community to make
Eclipse a better platform for all.

=== Capitalization


TIP: [guideline1.5]*Guideline 1.5* +
Use Headline style capitalization for menus, tooltip and all titles,
including those used for windows, dialogs, tabs, column headings and
push buttons. Capitalize the first and last words, and all nouns,
pronouns, adjectives, verbs and adverbs. Do not include ending
punctuation.


TIP: [guideline1.6]*Guideline 1.6* +
Use Sentence style capitalization for all control labels in a dialog or
window, including those for check boxes, radio buttons, group labels,
and simple text fields. Capitalize the first letter of the first word,
and any proper names such as the word Java.

=== Language
TIP: [guideline1.7]*Guideline 1.7* +
Create localized version of the resources within your plug-in.

=== Error Handling
TIP: [guideline1.8]*Guideline 1.8* +
When an error occurs which requires either an explicit user input or
immediate attention from users, communicate the occurrence with a modal
dialog.

TIP: [guideline1.9]*Guideline 1.9* +
If a programming error occurs in the product, communicate the occurrence
with a dialog, and log it.


== UI Graphics

=== Design
TIP: [guideline2.1]*Guideline 2.1* +
Follow the visual style established for Eclipse UI graphics.

TIP: [guideline2.2]*Guideline 2.2* +
Use a common color palette as the basis for creating graphical elements.

TIP: [guideline2.3]*Guideline 2.3* +
Re-use the core visual concepts to maintain consistent representation
and meaning across Eclipse plug-ins.

TIP: [guideline2.4]*Guideline 2.4* +
Re-use existing graphics from the Common Elements library or other
Eclipse-based plugins.

TIP: [guideline2.5]*Guideline 2.5* +
Create and implement the graphical versions of the disabled state of
toolbar and local toolbar icons.

TIP: [guideline2.6]*Guideline 2.6* +
Use the design templates for creating and maintaining UI graphics to
facilitate easy file sharing and efficient production of a large set of
graphics.

=== Specifications

TIP: [guideline2.7]*Guideline 2.7* +
Use the file format specified for the graphic type.

TIP: [guideline2.8]*Guideline 2.8* +
Use the appropriate graphic type in the location it is designed for
within the user interface.

TIP: [guideline2.9]*Guideline 2.9* +
Follow the specific size specifications for each type of graphic.

TIP: [guideline2.10]*Guideline 2.10* +
Cut the graphics with the specific placement shown to ensure alignment
in the user interface.

=== Implementation

TIP: [guideline2.11]*Guideline 2.11* +
Use the cutting actions provided to increase the speed and efficiency of
cutting a large number of graphics.

TIP: [guideline2.12]*Guideline 2.12* +
Abbreviate file name instead of using the full icon name, e.g., New
Interface becomes "newint".

TIP: [guideline2.13]*Guideline 2.13* +
Use lower case characters in your file names, e.g., DTD becomes "dtd".

TIP: [guideline2.14]*Guideline 2.14* +
Use 10 characters or fewer in your file names if possible (underscores
count as a character).

TIP: [guideline2.15]*Guideline 2.15* +
Use a file name suffix that describes its location or function in the
tool, e.g., newint_wiz, or its size in the case of icons that require
multiple sizes.

TIP: [guideline2.16]*Guideline 2.16* +
Keep the original file names provided.

TIP: [guideline2.17]*Guideline 2.17* +
Follow the predefined directory structure and naming convention.

TIP: [guideline2.18]*Guideline 2.18* +
Keep the original directory names provided.

TIP: [guideline2.19]*Guideline 2.19* +
Minimize duplication of graphics within a plugin by keeping all graphics
in one, or few, first level user interface directories.

TIP: [guideline2.20]*Guideline 2.20* +

The view label in the title bar must be prefixed with the label of the
view in the Perspective > Show View menu.

TIP: [guideline7.7]*Guideline 7.7* +
If a view contains more than one control, it may be advisable to split
it up into two or more views.

TIP: [guideline7.8]*Guideline 7.8* +
When a view first opens, derive the view input from the state of the
perspective.

TIP: [guideline7.9]*Guideline 7.9* +
If a view displays a resource tree, consider using the window input as
the root of visible information in the view.

TIP: [guideline7.10]*Guideline 7.10* +
Use the view pulldonw menu for presentation commands, not
selection-oriented commands.

TIP: [guideline7.11]*Guideline 7.11* +

If you just want to expose a single view, or two, extend an existing
perspective type.

TIP: [guideline8.3]*Guideline 8.3* +
The size and position of each view in a perspective should be defined in
a reasonable manner, such that the user can resize or move a view if
they desire it. When defining the initial layout, it is important to
consider the overall flow between the views (and editors) in the
perspective.

TIP: [guideline8.4]*Guideline 8.4* +
If a perspective has just one part, it may be better suited as a view or

toolbar if they will be frequently used.

TIP: [guideline9.4]*Guideline 9.4* +
Define each action set with a specific task in mind.

TIP: [guideline9.5]*Guideline 9.5* +
An action set should contain the smallest possible semantic chunking of
actions. Avoid the temptation to provide only one action set for an
entire plug-in.

TIP: [guideline9.6]*Guideline 9.6* +
Use an action set to share a set of actions which are useful in two or
more views or editors.

TIP: [guideline9.7]*Guideline 9.7* +

resources back to the Navigator.

=== The Tasks View

TIP: [guideline14.1]*Guideline 14.1* +
Add markers (tasks, errors and warnings) to the Tasks view using the
Marker Manager services from the Core Resources Management plugin.

TIP: [guideline14.2]*Guideline 14.2* +
The description text of each marker should be short and concise, so that
it will fit in the status line of Eclipse.

TIP: [guideline14.3]*Guideline 14.3* +
Add actions to the Tasks view menu, toolbar, and context menu using the
plug-in registry.

TIP: [guideline14.4]*Guideline 14.4* +
