= Accessibility

In a view, editor, or other control, every features should be accessible
using a mouse or the keyboard.

In a dialog or wizard, a shortcut key should be defined for each button
or control. The shortcut key should be displayed with an underline
beneath the appropriate shortcut character.

TIP: [guideline18.1]*Guideline 18.1* +
All of the features provided by a tool should be accessible using a
mouse or the keyboard.

The Eclipse platform has defined a large number of shortcut keys.
Plug-in developers should make sure that the existing shortcut keys do
not conflict with the shortcut keys defined in the plug-in.
