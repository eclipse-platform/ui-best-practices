= Standard Components

In this section we'll look at the standard components which ship with
Eclipse. The Eclipse SDK contains a number of views, including the
Navigator, Outline, Properties, Tasks, and Bookmarks view. Eclipse also
contains a default text editor and a Resource perspective.

As a plug-in developer, you should try to add new actions to the
existing parts. This leads to better integration with the platform, and
the existing knowledge of the user.

TIP: [guideline12.1]*Guideline 12.1* +
If appropriate, add actions to standard components of Eclipse using the
plug-in registry.

When extending the standard components such as the Navigator, Outline,
Properties, Tasks, and Bookmark views, make sure your specialized
components carry over the base component's characteristics (drag and
drop support, keyboard navigation, selection behaviour, etc.)

TIP: [guideline12.2]*Guideline 12.2* +
If you subclass or copy any of the standard components, always carry
over the standard components' characteristics.

== The Navigator View

The Navigator is used to navigate the workspace, create new resources,
modify resources, and open an editor on a resource. Plug-in developers
may contribute new actions to the menu, toolbar, and context menu.

=== Adding Actions

This is done by adding an extension to the plug-in registry.

TIP: [guideline13.1]*Guideline 13.1* +
Add actions to the Navigator View menu, toolbar, and context menu using
the plug-in registry.

If object contributions are made to the context menu, try to qualify the
target object as much as possible, to avoid adding the command to the
wrong objects in the Navigator. For instance, a Java command may target
IFiles with a .java extension, or IProjects with a Java nature. It will
cause confusion if Java actions appear on non-java objects.

Some actions are a reflection of tool use, rather than object type. For
instance, a repository plug-in may provide actions for file check in,
check out, etc. These actions should appear on the resources in the
Navigator only if the user has actively chosen to use the repository
tool. To control the visibility of these actions, the plug-in should
apply a project nature to the managed resources, and use the project
nature attribute in all context menu contributions.

For more information on command filtering, refer to
http://www.eclipse.org/articles/viewArticle/ViewArticle2.html[Creating
an Eclipse View]. The standard attributes for resources are defined in
IResourceActionFilter.java (see below).

[source,java]
----
public interface IResourceActionFilter extends IActionFilter {        
   public static final String NAME = "name";
   public static final String EXTENSION = "extension";
   public static final String PATH = "path";
   public static final String READ_ONLY = "readOnly";
   public static final String PROJECT_NATURE = "projectNature";
}
----

The standard attributes for project filtering are defined in
IProjectActionFilter.java.

[source,java]
----
public interface IProjectActionFilter extends IResourceActionFilter {
	public static final String NATURE = "nature";
	public static final String OPEN = "open";
}
----

TIP: [guideline13.2]*Guideline 13.2* +
Use the attributes defined in IResourceActionFilter.java and
IProjectActionFilter.java to control the visibility of context menu
actions in the Navigator.

=== Integration with Other Views and Editors

In Eclipse, the use of a "Navigate -> Show In" command is a common way
to link the selection in one view to the input of another. For instance,
a "Show in Package Explorer" command is visible in the context menu for
a selected class in the source editor. When invoked, the class in the
source editor is selected and revealed in the Package Explorer view.
This approach should be used as a general, non intrusive pattern for
view or editor linking. It is context sensitive, and reflects the
intentions of the user.

A "Navigate -> Show In Navigator" command should be included in any view
where a resource may appear. If invoked, the command should select and
reveal the resource in the navigator.

TIP: [guideline13.3]*Guideline 13.3* +
Use a "Navigate -> Show In Navigator" command in each view, to link
resources back to the Navigator.

== The Tasks View

The Tasks view is used to display the current tasks, errors and warnings
in the workspace. A plug-in developer may contribute new tasks, errors,
and warnings to the workspace, and rely upon the Tasks view to display
those objects. You can also contribute new actions to the menu, toolbar,
and context menu. This is done by adding an extension to the plug-in
registry.

=== Adding Tasks

A new task, error or warning can be created using the Marker Manager
services from the Core Resources Management plugin.

TIP: [guideline14.1]*Guideline 14.1* +
Add markers (tasks, errors and warnings) to the Tasks view using the
Marker Manager services from the Core Resources Management plugin.

The Tasks view is a table, containing columns for the task image,
completion status, priority, description, resource, and line number. The
description text of each marker should be short and concise, so that it
will fit in the status line of Eclipse.

TIP: [guideline14.2]*Guideline 14.2* +
The description text of each marker should be short and concise, so that
it will fit in the status line of Eclipse.

=== Adding Actions

You can contribute new actions to the menu, toolbar, and context menu.
This is done by adding an extension to the plug-in registry.

TIP: [guideline14.3]*Guideline 14.3* +
Add actions to the Tasks view menu, toolbar, and context menu using the
plug-in registry.

If object contributions are made to the context menu, try to qualify the
target object as much as possible, to avoid adding the command to the
wrong objects in the Tasks view. At an implementation level, each object
in the Tasks view is a __marker__, a general mechanism for associate
notes with a resource. Use the attributes within
IMarkerActionFilter.java to control the visibility of Task object
actions (see below). For more information on command filtering, refer to
http://www.eclipse.org/articles/viewArticle/ViewArticle2.html[Creating
an Eclipse View].

[source,java]
----
public interface IMarkerActionFilter extends IActionFilter {
	public static final String TYPE = "type";
	public static final String SUPER_TYPE = "superType";
	public static final String PRIORITY = "priority";
	public static final String SEVERITY = "severity";
	public static final String DONE = "done";
	public static final String MESSAGE = "message";
}
----

TIP: [guideline14.4]*Guideline 14.4* +
Use the attributes defined in IMarkerActionFilter.java to control the
visibility of context menu actions in the Tasks view.

=== Integration with Other Views and Editors

In an editor, task objects are commonly used to mark a location within a
document. Once a task has been created, it appears in the Task view. If
this task is selected (via double clicking), you should reopen the
editor at the location defined in the task. The focus should be changed
from the Task view to the editor.

If appropriate, support for the creation of new task objects in an
editor should be implemented by the editor. For more information on
this, see link:#Editors[Editors].

=== Adding F1 Help to Task View

Plug-ins should support F1 keyboard command and link it to an infopop
that gives a detailed description of the selected item in the Task view.

TIP: [guideline14.5]*Guideline 14.5* +
Support F1 keyboard command and link it to an infopop that gives a
detailed description of the selected item in the Task view.

== Selection Dialogs

When you want the user to select items from a given list of items, you
can use the standard selection dialogs available in Eclipse.

=== ContainerSelectionDialog

Use
http://help.eclipse.org/ganymede/topic/org.eclipse.platform.doc.isv/reference/api/org/eclipse/ui/dialogs/ContainerSelectionDialog.html[ContainerSelectionDialog]
when want to select an IContainer (IFolder/IProject) from the workspace.

[source,java]
----
ContainerSelectionDialog dialog = new ContainerSelectionDialog(window.getShell(), null, true, "Select a parent:");
dialog.setTitle("Container Selection");
dialog.open();
----

You can restrict the resource to be within a project/folder by passing
the respective object as the second parameter for the constructor.

=== ResourceSelectionDialog

The ContainerSelectionDialog allowed you to select only one resource
that too it should be a container. If you want to select multiple
resources including files, then
http://help.eclipse.org/ganymede/topic/org.eclipse.platform.doc.isv/reference/api/org/eclipse/ui/dialogs/ResourceSelectionDialog.html[ResourceSelectionDialog]
is the one you should be using.

[source,java]
----
ResourceSelectionDialog dialog = new ResourceSelectionDialog(window.getShell(), ResourcesPlugin.getWorkspace().getRoot(), "Select Resource:");
dialog.setTitle("Resource Selection");
dialog.open();
----

=== ResourceListSelectionDialog

The ResourceSelectionDialog is good when you want to present the entire
set of resources under a parent and allow the user to select multiple
resources. But if you have a set of resources and want the user to
select only one from that, then probably you should be using
http://help.eclipse.org/ganymede/topic/org.eclipse.platform.doc.isv/reference/api/org/eclipse/ui/dialogs/ResourceListSelectionDialog.html[ResourceListSelectionDialog].

[source,java]
----
ResourceListSelectionDialog dialog = new ResourceListSelectionDialog(window.getShell(), resourcesArray);
dialog.setTitle("Resource Selection");
dialog.open();
----

=== ElementListSelectionDialog

The above Dialogs are good to selecting workspace resources. But what if
I have some elements on my own and I want to select from that? The first
dialog you would be using is
http://help.eclipse.org/ganymede/topic/org.eclipse.platform.doc.isv/reference/api/org/eclipse/ui/dialogs/ElementListSelectionDialog.html[ElementListSelectionDialog].
The user can select an element from the set. You have to pass the
elements as an array and supply a label provider to render the element.
The user can filter using wildcards as well.

[source,java]
----
ElementListSelectionDialog dialog = new ElementListSelectionDialog(window.getShell(), new LabelProvider());
dialog.setTitle("String Selection");
dialog.setMessage("Select a String (* = any string, ? = any char):");
dialog.setElements(new Object[] { "one", "two", "three" });
dialog.open();
----

=== ListSelectionDialog

If you want the user to select multiple elements from the given set,
then
http://help.eclipse.org/ganymede/topic/org.eclipse.platform.doc.isv/reference/api/org/eclipse/ui/dialogs/ListSelectionDialog.html[ListSelectionDialog]
is the one to use. It is basically a single column TableViewer with
SWT.CHECK style applied. You have to supply your own ContentProvider and
LabelProvider for the TableViewer. It also has Select All & Deselect All
buttons.

[source,java]
----
ListSelectionDialog dlg = new ListSelectionDialog(window.getShell(), getInput(), getContentProvider(), getLabelProvider(), "Select the Element:");
dlg.setTitle("Element Selection");
dlg.open();
----

=== CheckedTreeSelectionDialog

If you have your items in a tree structure and want to select few
elements from them, then
http://help.eclipse.org/ganymede/topic/org.eclipse.platform.doc.isv/reference/api/org/eclipse/ui/dialogs/CheckedTreeSelectionDialog.html[CheckedTreeSelectionDialog]
is your choice. You have to bring your own content & label provider and
the input.

[source,java]
----
CheckedTreeSelectionDialog dialog = new CheckedTreeSelectionDialog(window.getShell(), getLabelProvider(), getContentProvider());
dialog.setTitle("Tree Selection");
dialog.setMessage("Select the elements from the tree:");
dialog.setInput(getInput());
dialog.open();
----

=== ElementTreeSelectionDialog

http://help.eclipse.org/ganymede/topic/org.eclipse.platform.doc.isv/reference/api/org/eclipse/ui/dialogs/ElementTreeSelectionDialog.html[ElementTreeSelectionDialog]
is the same as the CheckedTreeSelectionDialog except that it will allow
you to select a single element in the whole tree rather than multiple
elements.

[source,java]
----
ElementTreeSelectionDialog dialog = new ElementTreeSelectionDialog(window.getShell(), getLabelProvider(), getContentProvider());
dialog.setTitle("Tree Selection");
dialog.setMessage("Select the elements from the tree:");
dialog.setInput(getInput());
dialog.open();
----

=== FilteredItemsSelectionDialog

Have you used the Open Type (Ctrl + Shift + T) or Open Resource
(Ctrl+Shift+R) dialog? Its similar to the ElementListSelectionDialog,
but it has more features. It can select multiple items, display a detail
pane about the item that is currently selected, it can even remember
your previous selections; store them in history and present them before
the other choices. To have that functionality, you have to extend the
abstract class
http://help.eclipse.org/ganymede/topic/org.eclipse.platform.doc.isv/reference/api/org/eclipse/ui/dialogs/FilteredItemsSelectionDialog.html[FilteredItemsSelectionDialog]
and provide the necessary implementation.

== The Preference Dialog

The Preference Dialog is used to edit the global preference for a
feature in the workbench.

A new preference page should be created when you need to expose global
options to the user. For instance, the global preferences for Java
compilation are exposed as a group of preference pages in the Preference
Dialog. If these preferences are changed, they affect the entire Java
plug-in.

TIP: [guideline15.1]*Guideline 15.1* +
Global options should be exposed within the Preferences Dialog.

A preference page should not be used to expose the local options for a
particular instance of a view, editor, or window. In this situation, the
user will look to the menu and toolbar of the control itself to
customize it. If these options are exposed in the Preference Dialog, it
will blur the location of customization, and confuse the user.

TIP: [guideline15.2]*Guideline 15.2* +
Expose the preferences for a particular view, editor or window in the
view itself, via a menu or tool item.

=== Preference Page Design

In the simplest case, any plug-in which needs to expose an option to the
user will define a single preference page. This preference page should
contain all of the options for the plug-in, until the number of options
starts to overload the page. At that point a nested design for
preference pages should be adopted.

TIP: [guideline15.3]*Guideline 15.3* +
Start out with a single preference page. Then evolve to more if you need
to.

In a nested design, a root preference page is added to the preference
dialog, and then sub pages are added to the root preference page. The
root preference page should never be blank. Instead, it should contain
the most commonly used preferences, or those preferences which have a
wide spread effect upon the plug-in behavior. Beneath the root page, a
sub page should be created for each major chunk of functionality within
the plug-in.

There is no reason to set the focus in a preference page, because focus
is always set to the tree, by the Eclipse platform, after the preference
page is made visible.

TIP: [guideline15.4]*Guideline 15.4* +
If you create a preference group, use the root page for frequently used
preferences, or those preferences which have wide spread effect.
Specialize within the sub pages. The root preference page should not be
blank.

Each new plug-in should integrate its plug-in preferences, wizards, and
views into existing preference, wizard, and view categories where it
makes sense, rather than the blind creation of new categories for
itself.

TIP: [guideline15.5]*Guideline 15.5* +
Attempt to integrate plug-in preferences, wizards, and views into
existing categories for a new plug-in first, before considering the
creation of a new category.

== The Outline View

In Eclipse, there is a special relationship between an editor and the
Outline view. When an editor is opened, the Outline view will connect to
the editor, and ask it for an outline model. If the editor answers an
outline model, that model will be displayed in the Outline view whenever
the editor is active. The outline is used to navigate through the edit
data, or interact with the edit data at a higher level of abstraction.

If you are an editor developer, the relationship between an editor and
the Outline view is important. For more information on the collaboration
between these two, see link:component_dev.adoc#_editors[Editors].

== The Properties View

The Properties view shows the properties for the active part in the
workbench, or the selection within that part. These properties are
supplied by the active part itself. The Properties view is simply a
container for their presentation.

Within Eclipse, the properties for an object can be exposed using a
Properties dialog, or the Properties view. The Properties view is
commonly used to edit the properties for a set of objects in an editor,
where quick access to the properties is important, and you switch from
one object to another quickly.

For more information on the use of the Properties view, or Properties
dialog, refer to link:component_dev.adoc#_properties[Properties].

== The Bookmarks View

The Bookmarks view is used to bookmark files, and open them quickly. A
plug-in developer may contribute new bookmarks to the workspace, and
rely upon the Bookmarks view to display those bookmarks. You can also
contribute new actions to the menu, toolbar, and context menu. This is
done by adding an extension to the plug-in registry.

In an editor, bookmark objects are commonly used to mark a location
within a document. Once a bookmark has been created, it appears in the
Bookmarks view. If this bookmark is selected, you may reopen the editor
at the location defined in the bookmark.

If appropriate, support for the creation of new bookmark objects should
be implemented by the editor. For more information on this, see
link:component_dev.adoc#_editors[Editors].

== The Text Editor

The Text Editor is commonly used to edit text files. A plug-in developer
can contribute new actions to the menu, toolbar, and context menu. This
is done by adding an extension to the plug-in registry. For more
information on this, see link:component_dev.adoc#_editors[Editors].

== The Resource Perspective

The Resource perspective contains a Navigator, Outline, Task view, and
editor area. Plug-in developers may contribute a new command, action
set, or view to the Resource perspective. For more information, refer to
link:component_dev.adoc#_perspectives[Perspectives].
