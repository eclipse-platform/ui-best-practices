# ðŸŒŸ Dual Tone Eclipse Icon Pack

Welcome to the **Dual Tone Eclipse Icon Pack** â€” a community-driven collection of refreshed, high-quality vector icons for the Eclipse IDE. This initiative aims to improve the look and feel of Eclipse by replacing outdated icons with clean, scalable alternatives.

## ðŸŽ¨ Contribute Your Own Icons

Want to help improve Eclipse? You're welcome to contribute!  
We maintain a [Style Guide](STYLE_GUIDE.md) to ensure visual consistency across all icons.

### To get started:
1. Read the [Style Guide](STYLE_GUIDE.md).
2. Pick an icon from a Eclipse Plugin you'd like to improve.
3. Check if there is a similar or duplicate icon already created.
4. Submit a pull request in this repository with your updated or new icon.
5. Weâ€™ll review your contribution and help get it merged!

No contribution is too small â€” even a single icon makes a difference.
Thank you for helping to improve Eclipse!
